mainly based on Metric Factorization: Recommendation beyond Matrix Factorization

codes structure:
  src.jyb
    FMModel.scala: main-model 
    package.scala: basic function
    Param.scala: model-based parameters
    test.scala: IO for model

Assumption:
  the number of users >> the number of items
  thus, distributed users in blocks (like mllib.ALS), and store items locally (as A map)
